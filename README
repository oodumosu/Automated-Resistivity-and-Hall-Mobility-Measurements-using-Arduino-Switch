The goal of this project was to grow and characterize thin, semiconducting ZnO and Al-ZnO films. To accomplish this, I created a Labview program to interface with an ArduinoMega, which operate a 16-switch relay. This relay was then connected to a nano-voltmeter, current source, and my sample film (which would be in a uniform magnetic field for some measurements). Labview would then compile the data into a .csv file, which my Python code would interpret and record measurements for the sheet resistance, bulk resistivity, semiconductor type, Sheet Carrier Density, Bulk Carrier Density, and Hall Mobility.
