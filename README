The goal of this project was to grow and characterize thin, semiconducting ZnO and Al-ZnO films. To accomplish this, I created a Labview program to interface with an ArduinoMega, which operate a 16-switch relay. This relay was then connected to a nano-voltmeter, current source, and my sample film (which would be in a uniform magnetic field for some measurements). Labview would then compile the data into a .csv file, which my Python code would interpret and record measurements for the sheet resistance, bulk resistivity, semiconductor type, Sheet Carrier Density, Bulk Carrier Density, and Hall Mobility.

Contributions
This project was funded by Ithaca College H&S Summer Scholars Program and the Dana Internship Program, and completed in the summer of 2019.
The idea for the Arduino to switch relay came from https://github.com/UPRM-Physics-and-Electronics/ArduSwitch-F454.git
I used NIST's guide for data interpretation and charcaterization of the samples (https://www.nist.gov/pml/engineering-physics-division/popular-links/hall-effect/resistivity-and-hall-measurements)
